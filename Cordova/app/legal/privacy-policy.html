    <p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5">Snaphappi takes great care in protecting your privacy with clear and reasonable privacy settings. In order to provide our Services to you, however, our algorithms and Photo Editors both need access to your photos. Where human beings are involved, we promise to make reasonable efforts to limit human access to only those Editors who are assigned to your photos and/or your account. Furthermore, we promise to make reasonable efforts to control the “chain of custody” of your photos, including by keeping access logs relating to our editing system. Please also be aware that no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot guarantee, ensure, or warrant the absolute security of any information that you transmit to us. By using the Services, you acknowledge that any information that you transfer to us is transferred at your own risk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5">We take all reasonable measures to ensure that your photos and personally identifiable information remain as secure as reasonably possible. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access your personally identifiable information. These personnel must abide by our Privacy Policy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5">Here are some of the other security procedures that Snaphappi uses to protect your privacy:</span>
