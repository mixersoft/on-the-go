    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">For now, Snaphappi can support only JPG files with embedded EXIF data, which is the file format that comes out of every digital camera and smartphone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Note also that we can include on your </span><span class="c2">Curated Timeline</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;only JPG photos with valid EXIF timestamps. Digital cameras from as far back as the late 1990s automatically include these timestamps in the JPG files they produce. However, in some cases, software programs produced in the early days of digital photography erased the EXIF data. Unfortunately, if we don’t know when the photo was taken, we can’t put it on a timeline.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the event of any controversy, claim, action, or dispute arising out of or related to any transaction conducted using the Services, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Agreement (or any part of it) (a “Dispute”), the party asserting the Dispute shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party (by first class or registered mail) describing the facts and circumstances (including any relevant documentation) of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party thirty (30) days within which to respond to or settle the Dispute. Notice shall be sent to:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"><br>(1) customerservice@snaphappi.com, or <br>(2) to you at: your last-used billing address or the billing and/or shipping address in your online profile. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"><br>Both you and Snaphappi agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied prior to initiating any litigation or filing any claim against the other party. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the event the dispute is not finally resolved through the above dispute resolution procedure, you agree that such Dispute shall be finally decided by binding arbitration. All such Disputes shall be exclusively submitted to Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) for binding arbitration under its rules then in effect in the </span><span>Washington, D.C.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;area, before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c1"><span></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The arbitrator—and not any federal, state or local court or agency—shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The parties further agree that they may bring claims only in their individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. &nbsp;Arbitration shall likewise proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses relating to or arising from the arbitration.</span>

A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.

ANY CLAIM RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES OR SERVICES MUST BE BROUGHT WITHIN ONE YEAR. THAT ONE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINS ON THE DATE WHEN SUCH CLAIM FIRST COULD BE FILED. IF IT IS NOT FILED WITHIN THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD, THAT CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO YOU AND YOUR SUCCESSORS. IT ALSO APPLIES TO US AND OUR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.
